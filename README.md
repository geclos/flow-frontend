# Flow frontend

This repo is for demonstration purposes.

It contains all frontend code related to a personal project I'm working on in private.

## Stack

Fairly modern stack with React 16, Mobx, Flow for static typing, CSS modules.

I prefer Mobx as it requires less boilerplate and, hence, allows me to iterate faster. I use mobx-rest library to
follow API REST conventions and an orderly structure for my stores and collections.
